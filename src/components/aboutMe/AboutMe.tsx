          <p>
            I enrolled in a coding bootcamp and learned full-stack web
            development. My favorite part of programming is the problem-solving
            aspect. I love the feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a
            problem. My core stack is React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. I am
            also familiar with TypeScript and Prisma. I am always looking to
            learn new technologies. I am currently looking for a full-time
            position as a software developer. When I'm not coding, I enjoy
            playing video games, watching movies, and playing with my dog. I
            also enjoy learning new things. I am currently learning about
            history and philosophy. I'm also learning how to play the guitar.
